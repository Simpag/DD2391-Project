I started off by doing plenty of research about anti-virus software and prevention techniques.
Learnt about some common techniques and tools available. 

From there I started to develop the payload encryptor. 
It started off by just encrypting a python script, then during runtime it decrypts the script and runs it in memory. 
In order to prevent the need for dependencies on the victims computer (python, python libraries etc) I added an option to compile the encrypted payload into an executeable. 
This however requires two compilations, one compilation of the python payload in order to include all the dependencies of the payload and another compilation of the decryption stub with the encrypted binary.
Double compilation introduced some issues, trying to run a binary in memory instantly triggers windows protections. Thus in order to bypass this one could inject the binary into another running process 
or simply write the binary to disk and run it. I chose to do the latter since it was simpler and I could not get the former one to work. 
From there on I setup a virtual machine running the latest update of windows in order to safely test on. 
This was initially enough to bypass windows defender, but as automatic file submission was turned on for suspicious programs the virus got detected after a couple of days.
Then with the help of Deniel we spent hours trying to identify what was triggering windows defender. 
We tried techniques such as delaying execution, performing fake calculation in order to act as a legitimate program and similar.
What we found was that removing the UI made our ransomware bypass the anti-virus once again.
This led us to believe that they used some kind of static analysis to identify keywords in our strings. 
Thus I implemented string encryption of the payload in order to hide them from static analysis.
Unfortunetly this was not enough and we assumed that it must have something to do with the binary size, thus I implemented a simple system for randomizing the binary file size. 
This finally allowed us to bypass the windows defender.

I contributed to the documentation, specifically testing, references and payload encryptor parts along with some minor corrections. 
I also contributed to the presentation.

Since i was assigned the ransomware itself i began by reading up on how to quickly and securely encrypt the data
and pretty quickly settled on a AES encryption in CTR mode for efficient encryption of a large amount of files.
The CTR mode also requires a nonce and i chose to randomize a nonce for every single file
and prepend the nonce to the file for security and later ease of decryption since there is no need to keep the nonce secret from the victim.
After implementing the encryption and the file traversal, which ended up being a really simple
depth first traversal (more could be made to have it navigate the file system more intelligently).
Taking inspiration from the Wannacry ransomware i decided to have it encrypt common "productivity" files such as videos, images, docx files
and similar files by searching for the file extensions from a python set (the full list is in the code) the reason for this
is because we wanted to leave the user able to use their computer but not have access to the information for ransom reasons
this simplified the programming so we didnt have to figure out how to show a UI on screen without an operating system.

After finishing on a reasonable encryption software there was the problem of retrieving and saving the key.
After reading up on how this was usually done i settled on a simple C2 server using FastAPI that would, upon request, 
supply a RSA public key with which we could encrypt the AEC key and send it over to be saved on the server.
Due to my relative ignorance of python this work took me longer than anticipated but i feel like it resulted in a reasonably functional malware

After the code was "finished" there was a bunch of testing that had to be done, for obvious reasons the full test of encryption of a full computer
had to be postponed until we had the complete program and an updated windows VM. Which turned out to be lucky because windows defender seemed to 
learn from our program while we were testing it forcing us to fiddle with the obfuscation.

I contributed to documentation, ransomware, and C2 server as well as helping with some testing.
